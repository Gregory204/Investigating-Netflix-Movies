# What is this about?
This is based on data from netflix about Netflix where I did a few assignements to find movies that are shorter than 60 mins, filtering the data to where we only have movies (also keeping the 
columns that give us more information for these movies), and last but not least creating a scatter
plot that will help determine of netflix movies are becoming shorter as time goes on.

How?
This was done using matplotlib and pandas. I used some techniques I have aquired from data camp to handle with sorting, slicing, and indexing to get the data I need.

# Why?
I have been getting really into data recently and wanted to try this task and see how well I could answer the questions that were given to me. Using the data from the csv made me feel like I can do whatever I set my mind to and learning about data analysis is really cool for me. But in the future I hope to build my knowledge more for deep learning, machine learning, and hopefully artificial intelligence.

# Whats next? 
Hopefully I can work on more things relating to data because this stuff is fun for me to do and learn about so I only see it as a pro for me to work with something I enjoy doing and especially if it helps others around me. (More Projects coming soon)
